![image35.png](/images/5-Workshop/5.4-Backend-deployment/5.4.4-creating-AWS-lambda/image35.png)


### 2. Write and Optimize Docker File


![image36.png](/images/5-Workshop/5.4-Backend-deployment/5.4.4-creating-AWS-lambda/image36.png)


### 3. Create Repository on Amazon ECR (via AWS CLI)

Open PowerShell and execute command


![image37.png](/images/5-Workshop/5.4-Backend-deployment/5.4.4-creating-AWS-lambda/image37.png)


### 3.1. Configure ECR Lifecycle Policy (storage cost optimization)

To optimize Amazon ECR storage costs long-term, configure a Lifecycle Policy that automatically cleans up old images on the `smartdocai` repository:

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "rulePriority": 1,
      "description": "Expire untagged images older than 1 day",
      "selection": {
        "tagStatus": "untagged",
        "countType": "sinceImagePushed",
        "countUnit": "days",
        "countNumber": 1
      },
      "action": { "type": "expire" }
    },
    {
      "rulePriority": 2,
      "description": "Keep only the last 5 tagged images",
      "selection": {
        "tagStatus": "tagged",
        "tagPrefixList": ["latest"],
        "countType": "imageCountMoreThan",
        "countNumber": 5
      },
      "action": { "type": "expire" }
    }
  ]
}
```

Apply it with:

```powershell
aws ecr put-lifecycle-policy --repository-name smartdocai --region us-east-1 --lifecycle-policy-text file://ecr-lifecycle-policy.json
```

> **Note:** Since `buildspec.yml` always builds/pushes with the fixed tag `latest`, there is usually only 1 image carrying that tag at any given time — the "keep 5 tagged images" rule rarely has any real effect. The rule that actually matters is expiring `untagged` images after 1 day, which cleans up old images that get replaced on every deploy.


### 4. Authenticate Docker CLI to Amazon ECR (AUTHENTICATION)

Since Amazon ECR requires temporary security token authentication (valid for 12 hours), fetch a temporary password from AWS ECR and pipe directly to Docker Login


![image38.png](/images/5-Workshop/5.4-Backend-deployment/5.4.4-creating-AWS-lambda/image38.png)


Result: Login Success indicates completion

### 5. Build Docker Image and Push to Amazon ECR

#### 5.1. Build Docker Image

Enter command in Terminal


![image39.png](/images/5-Workshop/5.4-Backend-deployment/5.4.4-creating-AWS-lambda/image39.png)


#### 5.2. Push Docker Image to ECR Repository


![image40.png](/images/5-Workshop/5.4-Backend-deployment/5.4.4-creating-AWS-lambda/image40.png)


### 6. Synchronize Docker Image with AWS Lambda

Open terminal and enter CLI command to synchronize


![image41.png](/images/5-Workshop/5.4-Backend-deployment/5.4.4-creating-AWS-lambda/image41.png)


Result:


![image42.png](/images/5-Workshop/5.4-Backend-deployment/5.4.4-creating-AWS-lambda/image42.png)


#### 6.1. Develop Backend Mangum Handler & Configuration

#### 6.1.1. Configure temporary storage path in backend/config.py

AWS Lambda environment is Stateless and only permits writing temporary data to `/tmp`


![image43.png](/images/5-Workshop/5.4-Backend-deployment/5.4.4-creating-AWS-lambda/image43.png)


#### 6.1.2. Create Mangum Handler in backend/app_api.py

Use Mangum library to convert HTTP Requests from AWS API Gateway to FastAPI ASGI Format


![image44.png](/images/5-Workshop/5.4-Backend-deployment/5.4.4-creating-AWS-lambda/image44.png)


#### 6.2. Create IAM ROLE and Permissions for AWS Lambda

Lambda requires interaction permissions with S3, DynamoDB, Bedrock, and CloudWatch

##### 6.2.1. Create Trust Policy (trust-policy.json):


![image46.png](/images/5-Workshop/5.4-Backend-deployment/5.4.4-creating-AWS-lambda/image46.png)


##### 6.2.2. Run AWS CLI commands to create Role and attach Managed Policies


![image47.png](/images/5-Workshop/5.4-Backend-deployment/5.4.4-creating-AWS-lambda/image47.png)


#### 6.4. Package Container & Push Docker Image to Amazon ECR


![image48.png](/images/5-Workshop/5.4-Backend-deployment/5.4.4-creating-AWS-lambda/image48.png)


### 7. Initialize AWS Lambda Function

#### 7.1. Open Terminal or PowerShell


![image49.png](/images/5-Workshop/5.4-Backend-deployment/5.4.4-creating-AWS-lambda/image49.png)


#### 7.2. Initialize Lambda Function via AWS CLI

##### 7.2.1. Create Lambda Function from ECR Container Image

This function acts as Backend Core handling all API logic and AI RAG


![image50.png](/images/5-Workshop/5.4-Backend-deployment/5.4.4-creating-AWS-lambda/image50.png)


Next, configure all 7 Environment Variables


![image51.png](/images/5-Workshop/5.4-Backend-deployment/5.4.4-creating-AWS-lambda/image51.png)


Grant API Gateway permissions to invoke this Lambda function


![image52.png](/images/5-Workshop/5.4-Backend-deployment/5.4.4-creating-AWS-lambda/image52.png)


##### 7.2.2. Create Lambda Function from Source Zip File

This function serves as Cognito Pre Sign-up Trigger to clean unverified email users


![image53.png](/images/5-Workshop/5.4-Backend-deployment/5.4.4-creating-AWS-lambda/image53.png)


Then grant Cognito User Pool permissions to invoke this Lambda function


![image54.png](/images/5-Workshop/5.4-Backend-deployment/5.4.4-creating-AWS-lambda/image54.png)


Result:


![image55.png](/images/5-Workshop/5.4-Backend-deployment/5.4.4-creating-AWS-lambda/image55.png)

### 8. Configure Amazon EventBridge Rule for Automatic Garbage Account Cleanup

To automatically clean up unconfirmed garbage accounts created over 5 minutes ago where users have not verified their email OTP in Cognito:

- **Create EventBridge Rule (`smartdocai-cleanup-unconfirmed`)**: Configure a 5-minute recurring schedule (`rate(5 minutes)`).
- **Target Event Payload**: Configure sending JSON payload with `"source": "aws.events"` property to the `smartdocai` AWS Lambda function.
- **Processing Mechanism**: When an event is received from EventBridge, the Lambda Handler in `app_api.py` detects `"source": "aws.events"` and invokes `cleanup_unconfirmed_users()`. This function scans Cognito User Pool and executes `admin_delete_user` for accounts in `UNCONFIRMED` status created more than 5 minutes ago.

```bash
# 1. Create EventBridge Rule scheduled every 5 minutes
aws events put-rule \
    --name smartdocai-cleanup-unconfirmed \
    --schedule-expression "rate(5 minutes)" \
    --state ENABLED

# 2. Grant EventBridge permissions to invoke AWS Lambda
aws lambda add-permission \
    --function-name smartdocai \
    --statement-id EventBridgeCleanupPermission \
    --action lambda:InvokeFunction \
    --principal events.amazonaws.com \
    --source-arn arn:aws:events:us-east-1:ACCOUNT_ID:rule/smartdocai-cleanup-unconfirmed

# 3. Add Lambda Function as Target with JSON Payload {"source": "aws.events"}
aws events put-targets \
    --rule smartdocai-cleanup-unconfirmed \
    --targets "Id"="1","Arn"="arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:ACCOUNT_ID:function:smartdocai","Input"="{\"source\": \"aws.events\"}"
```
