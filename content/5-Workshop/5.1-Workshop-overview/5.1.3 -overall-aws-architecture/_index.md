After exploring the Frontend and Backend architecture separately in the previous two sections, this section brings everything together into a **complete picture** of how the AWS components work together to form the full SmartDocAI system, along with the per-user data storage structure.

### 1. Overall Architecture Diagram

<img src="/images/5-Workshop/5.1-Workshop-overview/5.1.3-overall-aws-architecture/architecture-diagram.png" width="100%" style="max-width:1100px">

**Flow legend (numbered in the diagram):**

| # | Flow | # | Flow |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Users → CloudFront | 9 | GitHub Repository → CodePipeline (Backend) |
| 2 | CloudFront → S3 Frontend Bucket | 10 | CodePipeline (Backend) → CodeBuild |
| 3 | CloudFront → API Gateway (proxy `/api/*`) | 11 | CodeBuild → Amazon ECR |
| 4 | API Gateway → Lambda | 12 | ECR → Lambda (deploy new container) |
| 5 | Lambda → Cognito User Pool (validate JWT) | 13 | GitHub Repository → CodePipeline (Frontend) |
| 6 | Lambda → Data Storage (DynamoDB + S3) | 14 | CodePipeline (Frontend) → S3 Frontend Bucket |
| 7 | Lambda → Amazon Bedrock (LLM + Embeddings) | 15 | Cognito ↔ Google Identity Provider (OAuth) |
| 8 | EventBridge → Lambda (cleanup every 5 minutes) | 16 | Cognito ↔ Lambda presignup-check (merge account) |

> The diagram is split into **2 separate CodePipelines**: CodePipeline (Backend) inside the "CI/CD Pipeline (backend)" group handles build/test/deploy to Lambda; CodePipeline (Frontend) sits inside the "Frontend (CDN + Static Hosting)" group and deploys straight to the S3 Frontend Bucket. Both receive code from the same GitHub repository (arrows 9 and 13). The diagram is also wrapped in a **Region: us-east-1** boundary, plus a **Generic Group (Account-wide)** box containing IAM Roles + AWS KMS — account-wide components that don't belong to any single tier.

SmartDocAI is built on a **Serverless Container Architecture** combined with **Managed Identity (Cognito)**, consisting of the following main components:

| Component | AWS Service | Specific Value |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend hosting | S3 + CloudFront | `https://dutf3c70nnjzl.cloudfront.net` |
| Backend API | Lambda + API Gateway | `https://d60866voq5.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod` |
| Authentication | Cognito User Pool | `us-east-1_3oq5wIiuu` |
| Cognito Hosted UI | Cognito | `https://smartdocai-fayrun2026.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com` |
| PreSignUp trigger | Lambda | `smartdocai-presignup-check` |
| Profile database | DynamoDB | `smartdocai-user-profiles` (SSE-KMS) |
| File & Index storage | S3 | `smartdocai-storage-623035187993` (Intelligent-Tiering) |
| LLM | Bedrock | `qwen.qwen3-next-80b-a3b` |
| Embeddings | Bedrock | `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0` (1024 dimensions) |
| CI/CD | 2 separate CodePipelines | `smartdocai-be-pipeline` (Backend), `smartdocsai-fe-pipeline` (Frontend) |
| Scheduled task | EventBridge | Rule to clean up unconfirmed users (rate 5 minutes) |
| Monitoring | CloudWatch + SNS | Alarms for Lambda Errors/Duration/Throttles + API Gateway 5xx, email alerting (see section 5.5.5) |
| Access & encryption | IAM + KMS | IAM Roles for Lambda/CodeBuild, KMS key encrypting DynamoDB |

### 2. Data Storage Structure

<img src="/images/5-Workshop/5.1-Workshop-overview/5.1.3-overall-aws-architecture/storage-structure.png" width="110%" style="max-width:900px">

All data is designed to be **isolated per user** (`user_id` = Cognito `sub`), preventing cross-account data leaks:

- `uploads/{user_id}/` — original documents (PDF/DOCX) uploaded by the user
- `vectorstore/{user_id}/` — per-user FAISS index (1024 dimensions) for semantic search
- `chat_history/{user_id}.json` — RAG conversation history
- `processed_files/{user_id}.json` — list of documents that have finished processing
- DynamoDB `smartdocai-user-profiles` (partition key `user_id`) — stores only the `avatar_url` field (other personal information such as full name, phone number, date of birth is stored directly in Cognito attributes to avoid data mismatch between two storage locations)

### 3. Backend Modularization (Lambda Modules)

<img src="/images/5-Workshop/5.1-Workshop-overview/5.1.3-overall-aws-architecture/lambda-modules.png" width="110%" style="max-width:1300px">

`app_api.py` serves as the main entry point (FastAPI + Mangum adapter), routing requests to specialized modules under `modules/`: `auth_service.py` (authentication), `document_processor.py` + `vector_store.py` (document processing & indexing), `rag_chain.py` + `self_rag.py` + `co_rag.py` (3 RAG modes), `profile_service.py` (user profile).

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline

<img src="/images/5-Workshop/5.1-Workshop-overview/5.1.3-overall-aws-architecture/cicd-pipeline.png" width="100%" style="max-width:1100px">

The system has **2 separate CodePipelines**, both receiving code from the same GitHub repository:

- **CodePipeline (Backend)** `smartdocai-be-pipeline`: Every time code is pushed to the `main` branch, it automatically triggers CodeBuild: install dependencies → lint with flake8 → run pytest (hard-fail if tests do not pass) → build Docker image → push to ECR → update the Lambda function. This mechanism ensures that broken code cannot make it into production.
- **CodePipeline (Frontend)** `smartdocsai-fe-pipeline`: builds the React/Vite application and deploys the result straight to the S3 Frontend Bucket, without a separate test/CodeBuild step since it's just static files.
